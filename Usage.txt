	 I'm not responsible for the lost you can do your system with this file...as it depends on your
	 intelligence of using file in Useful way...

	Fn.dll is an amazing (6 Kb in size) file... it can take following parameters ...

1. Sleep [time] :- 
		you can pause the whole batch file by passing 'sleep' as parameter as defined in syntax !!
		and time is the amount of time to stop the consol in milliseconds...

		Syntax : fn.dll sleep 1000

		to stop console for 1 second.

2. Kbd :-
		You can get the ASCII code of any key pressed on the Keyboard..and it returns ASCII code
		in the variable 'ERRORLEVEL' ...

		syntax : fn.dll kbd 

3. mouse :-
		You can get the co-ordinates of area where User has clicked with mouse..and it returns co-ordinates
		and the key_id ...which is pressed...

		syntax : fn.dll mouse
		output : [e.g.] 12 25 1
		then line no.=12
			column = 25
			and left clicked there...if there is 2 instead of 1,then right clicked there...

4. color :-
